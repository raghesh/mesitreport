\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
\thispagestyle{empty}
First and foremost we offer our sincerest gratitude to our project guide,
Asst. Prof ABC, who has supported us thoughout our thesis with patience
and knowledge whilst allowing us the room to work in our own way. We attribute
the success of this project work to his encouragement and effort and without
him/her this report, too, would not have been completed or written. One simply
could not wish for a better or friendlier supervisor. 

We would also wish to place on record our gratitude to the assistance we
received from our laboratory supervisors, viz, Ms ABC, Ms BBC and Ms ABB.

The ideas used in this project have been originally proposed by Institute
of XXYY and we would like to acknowledge Prof ABBC and his team. 

The funds for doing this project came from M/S NKN and M/S NBB. We would
like to acknowledge their services.

Our friends and colleagues, viz, Mr ANB, Ms NMC etc helped us a lot in the
initial phases. We also would like to thank M/S NGH for the printing of this report.
